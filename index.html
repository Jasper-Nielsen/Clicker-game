            <br />
            You have just arrived at Christmas dinner with the family.
            Unbeknownst to you this year’s putlock feats theme is healthy foods.
            Everyone has brought healthy dishes except you. As the industrious
            person you are, you have made a whole Christmas dinner with three
            very non healthy courses. Your family making fun of you and berating
            you for bringing fatty unhealthy food, laughs at your contribution
            through the entire setting of the table. That is until you all sit
            down. <br />Everyone stares at your perfectly cooked goose with
            gravy and coated potatoes and all of your other dishes with longing.
            Everyone else has loaded their plates with healthy food stuff. But
            they are not eating, just pushing the food around on the plate. The
            attention and hypocrisy is palpable, as you take a knife and cut a
            piece of the goose. Complete silence all eyes follow the cut’s
            travel to your plate. Only thing to be heard is the meat as it hits
            your plate.<br />
            Bang! Chairs falling over, cutlery clanking when all hell breaks
            loose as each person frantically reaches out for their desired food.
            A hand snatches the piece on your plate. Your brother shouting “you
            snooze you lose”. Filled with frustration you look around the room,
            watching as your parents each with their hands on the gravy boat,
            trying to wrestle it from the other, and your sister has planted her
            face in the rice pudding. Seeing no food easily accessible you
            picking up a piece something leafy green, and chews on it. <br />
            It dawns on you. Your brother has brought a sautéed piece of kale, a
            piece of fucking KALE!!. This will not stand. No one is going to
            laugh at your dinner, bring “delicious” healthy food, eat your well
            prepared dinner and get away with it. Show them what you are made
            of. Eat your fill! Be vigilant: don’t let anyone take from your
            plate. Be quick, before you know it. All the good stuff will be
            gone.
