            Winner Winner Christmas Dinner You have just arrived at Christmas
            dinner with the family. Unbeknownst to you this year’s putlock feat
            theme is healthy foods. Everyone has brought healthy dishes except
            you. As the industrious person you are, you have made a whole
            Christmas dinner with three very non healthy courses. Your family
            making fun of you and berating you for bringing fatty unhealthy
            food, laugh at your contribution through the entire setting of the
            table. That’s until you all sit down. Everyone stares at your
            perfectly cooked goose with gravy and coated potatoes and all of
            your other dishes with longing. Everyone else has loaded their
            plates with healthy food stuff. But they are not eating, just
            pushing the food around on the plate. The attention and hypocrisy is
            palpable, as you take a knife and cut a piece of the goose. Complete
            silence all eyes follow the cut’s travel to your plate. Only thing
            to be heard is the meat as it hits your plate. Bang chairs falling
            over, cutlery clanking when all hell breaks loose as each person
            frantically reaches out for their desired food. A hand snatches the
            piece on your plate. Your brother shouting “you snooze you lose”.
            Filled with frustration you look around the room, watching as your
            parents each with their hands on the gravy boat, trying to wrestle
            it from the other, and your sister has planted her face in the rice
            pudding. Seeing no food easily accessible you picking up a piece
            something leafy green, and chews on it. Your brother has brought a
            sautéed piece of kale, a piece of fucking KALE!!. This will not
            stand. No one is going to laugh at your dinner, bring “delicious”
            healthy food eat your well prepared dinner and get away with it.
            Show them what you are made of. Eat your fill! Be vigilant: don’t
            let anyone take from your plate. Be quick, before you know it. All
            the good stuff will be gone.
